First thing
For the method PrintHelloWorld I guess this is the one where like I print "Hello, World!\n" to the screen

Seems straightforward enough.

Second thing

In my x99Bottles program _99Bottles(with that weird underscore in front of it) first I want
to make a variable called bottles which is an integer.

um
Then I get to this ridiculous part where I have to keep checking the value of this bottles.

Is it one, is it zero, special cases all over
If it IS zero(and I do not understand why we do zero first but), here is my string : "No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer\n" followed by "Went to the store to buy some more, " which then puts us back to "99 Bottles of beer on the wall.\n\n"
Then we break

Next is a test for one


/*
void Variation2::HelloWorld()
{
I print("Hello, World!\n");
}

int Variation2::_99Bottles()
{
int bottleCount = 99;

I do
{
switch(bottleCount)
{
In the case of 0:
I print("No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.\n");
I also print("Went to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.\n\n");
I break;
In the case of 1:
I will print("1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.\n");
I will also print("Took one down and passed it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.\n\n");
I will then break;
In the case of 2:
I print("2 bottle of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer.\n");
I print("Took one down and passed it around, 1 more bottle of beer on the wall.\n\n");
break;
If I find the default:
I print("%d bottles of beer on the wall, %d bottles of beer.\n", bottleCount, bottleCount);
I also print("Took one down and passed it around, %d bottles of beer on the wall.\n\n", bottleCount - 1);
}
bottleCount--;
} while (bottleCount >= 0);

I return 0;
}
